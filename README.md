# ST-Assignment-3
**ROLL # : 21L-7572** 
The task is related to CI/CD (continues integration and continues deployment). You have to create CI/CD pipeline using GitHub workflow
**Instructions:**
1. Create public GitHub repo (name it whatever you want)
2. Add Readme file with our roll number and in it
3. Push the code of assignment 2 (the original code I provided). Need to push whole project with test case (the error of the code should not be corrected (“SQL statement correction”))
4. Take a pull for that code in your local machine
5. In GitHub create a work flow such that it allows the code only to be merged in main OR master branch only if it passes all the unit test
6. You will have to create rules for main branch and also define work flow for executing test automatically
7. To test pipeline, push the code to some branch and try to merge it with main Or master branch with some small change like adding print statement (do not correct the code).
8. The GitHub workflow will run automatically and will try to run the unit test you provided.
9. After the complete execution of flow is complete, take a screenshot and save it
10. In next step update the code (“SQL statement”) and push the code again to some branch. Follow the same steps from point 7 to 9.
